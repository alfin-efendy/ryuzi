//! ACP client transport utilities: adapter spawn + capability extraction.
//!
//! The SINGLE site that assembles the `Client.builder()` chain — wiring
//! notification sink, permission handler, fs handlers, and capabilities — is
//! [`super::run_client_loop`] in `mod.rs`. This module only owns:
//!
//! - [`spawn_adapter`]: spawns the ACP adapter sidecar process (production).
//! - [`PermissionContext`]: the shared state bundle for the permission handler.
//!
//! The previous `connect_and_initialize` helper that duplicated the builder
//! assembly is removed. Its tests now go through the testkit helpers (which
//! drive `run_client_loop` via the mock runner), keeping a single builder site.
